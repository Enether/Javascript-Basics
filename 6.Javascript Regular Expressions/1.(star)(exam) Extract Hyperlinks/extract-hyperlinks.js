/*
 Write a JavaScript function to extract all hyperlinks (<href=â€¦>) from given text.
 The text comes as array of strings, passed as parameter to your function.
 Print at the console the href values in the text.
 The input text is standard HTML code. It may hold many tags and can be formatted in many different forms
 (with or without whitespace). The <a> elements may have many attributes, not only href. You should extract
  only the values of the href attributes of all <a> elements.
